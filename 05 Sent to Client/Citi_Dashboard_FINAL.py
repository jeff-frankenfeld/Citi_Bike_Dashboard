    ### **Key Insights**
    - Bike ridership follows a seasonal pattern, peaking in warmer months and dropping in winter.
    - **Cold weather (below 10¬∞C)** leads to a noticeable **decline in bike rides**.
    - **Warmer temperatures (above 15¬∞C)** are associated with **higher ridership**, showing a clear correlation.

    ### **Key Insights**
    - **Bike demand shifts seasonally**, impacting which stations receive the most trips.
    - **W 21 St & 6 Ave consistently ranks as the top station across all seasons**, with **West St & Chambers St** also maintaining high ridership.
    - **Winter:** Commuter-heavy stations like **1 Ave & E 68 St** see increased usage.
    - **Spring & Summer:** Tourist-friendly stations (**West St & Chambers St, Broadway & W 58 St**) experience a **surge in demand**.
    - **Fall:** Work commute patterns return, making **W 21 St & 6 Ave the leading station** again.
    
    ### **What This Means**
    - **Different seasons influence trip patterns**, requiring **seasonal bike redistribution**.
    - **Commuter vs. Tourist Impact:** Warm months see increased **tourist usage**, while **cold months favor work commuters**.

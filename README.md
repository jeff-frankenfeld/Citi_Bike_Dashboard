# Citi Bike Usage Analysis & Dashboard

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes **New York City's Citi Bike usage patterns** to uncover **distribution inefficiencies** and provide **data-driven recommendations** for improving bike availability. Using **Python, Pandas, Plotly, Kepler.gl, and Streamlit**, I developed an **interactive dashboard** that visualizes key insights, including:  
- How **weather impacts ridership**  
- The **most frequently used stations**  
- **Aggregated trip patterns** across the city  
- Differences in **weekday vs. weekend activity**  
- Actionable strategies to **optimize Citi Bike logistics**

## Key Features

### Interactive Dashboard
- Built using **Streamlit** for an intuitive user experience
- Modular navigation to explore different analytical perspectives
- Filter views by **season**, **station**, or **trip activity**

### Analytical Insights
- **Seasonal Trends:** Ridership peaks in warmer months and dips in winter  
- **Popular Stations:** `W 21 St & 6 Ave` is the top start station year-round  
- **User Behavior:**  
  - **Weekday commuters** dominate Chelsea & Midtown  
  - **Tourists and casual riders** frequent Central Park & Roosevelt Island  
- **Hourly Usage:**  
  - Weekday spikes at **8 AM and 5â€“7 PM**  
  - Weekend activity is more **evenly spread** and peaks mid-afternoon

### Strategic Recommendations
- Redistribute bikes based on **seasonal demand**
- Expand docking stations in **high-tourism areas**
- Use **real-time data** for smarter bike rebalancing
- Offer **seasonal promotions** to encourage year-round usage
